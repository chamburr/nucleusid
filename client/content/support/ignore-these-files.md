title: Ignore these files
description: Files to ignore when marking.
---

There are certain files that are either not written by me or should be otherwise ignored when
marking this project. The list is below.

- `client/assets/scss/argon/*`: These code were not written by me. Only slight modifications made.
- `client/assets/components/Base*`: They are mostly heavily referenced from elsewhere.
- `client/static/sw.js`: This file is automatically generated.
- `server/models/__init__.py`: This file is automatically generated.
